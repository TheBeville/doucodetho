# Doucodetho (do-you-code-though?)

Taking inspiration (both for the name and the gamification) from Duolingo and its 
highly-motivating daily streak system, this is an app designed to both track and 
encourage the regularity of coding sessions, hopefully keeping up levels motivation 
and consistency.

It's all very simple - once you've created an account, just open the app when first
starting to code each day and tap to update your streak, keeping it alive. If you 
miss a day, your streak will obviously reset to zero, but your current longest streak 
remains visible onscreen as a target to reach and surpass.

# Getting Started

When you launch the app for the first time, you'll be prompted to log in or create an 
account. This requires only a username, email address and password, and once you're 
done you are re-directed to the main screen of the app. There's not much else to the
simple user interface, so start building that streak today!
